# PyTunes.py

## As of May 1st 2018, PyTunes is no longer in development.
A fully standalone media player coded entirely in Python3. Ultimately useless as a program, but that's not why it exists. This program is purely to "show off" capabilities of python and for users to clone chunks of code from it to use for their own program. Enjoy!
Note - PyTunesInstaller should not be needed unless you can't download the file directly for some reason. If you can only download one file, download that one, and it'll install PyTunes for you. I'm not sure how the program will react if you run the installer while PyTunes already exists, so don't run it if you already have. Just saying.
